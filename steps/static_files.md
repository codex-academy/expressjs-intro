# Static files

So far we created some routes, but added no style as we haven't had any full web pages. We can change our web server configuration to allow it to display static files.

You should have a basic Express JS setup in place which can be used as a baseline to get some basic reports up and running.

See more details about this at [Serving static files in Express](http://expressjs.com/starter/static-files.html).

Let's go ahead:

* and add a public folder in your spaza-app folder
* change your server.js file to render static files from the public folder using this, `app.use(express.static('public'));`
* in the public folder create a file called index.html and add some content to it
* Navigate to the file using http://localhost:3000/index.html
* If you are using nodemon no server restart would be required. If not, restart your server (please start using nodemon!).
* Going forward you will be able to use the public folder to store and reference css files and images from.
