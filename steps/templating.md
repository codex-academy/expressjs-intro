# Templates

## Templating

We will be using `handlebars` as the template engine, it combines data with templates to render information.

A typical handlebars template look likes this

```handlebars
<div class="entry">
  {{#if author}}
    <h1>{{firstName}} {{lastName}}</h1>
  {{/if}}
</div>
```

Combining the above with data like this:

```javascript
var user = {
 author : true,
 firstName : "Jo",
 lastName : "Blogss"
};
```

results in a html enriched with some data.

Handlebars JS is built on top of Mustache templating engine and extends it. Mustache templating aims to be logic-less templating, but that aim makes it hard to use at times.

See some more information on how the templates works on [the Mustache website](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).

See some background information on the difference between Handlebars and Mustache: [What are the differences between Mustache.js and Handlebars.js?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10555820/what-are-the-differences-between-mustache-js-and-handlebars-js)

Handlebars comes with a set of built in helpers that makes it easy for one to process data and convert it into a layout. It [supports things like if statements and loops](http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html).

## Combining templates & data

As we need to display the data in the web browser we use the templates, which is how we would like the data to be displayed, with what needs to be displayed, which is the data.

It goes like this:

```
template + data = web page
```

So we somehow need to combine templates and data in Express JS. Luckily there is already a [Node module that is combining Express JS and Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars).

Integrate handlebars templating into your spaza-app Express application.
